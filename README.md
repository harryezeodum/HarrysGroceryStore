**Title:**   Grocery Store Web Application

**Author:**  Harry Ezeodum

**Introduction**
The main idea is for users to be able to shop their favorite neighborhood grocery store online and either pick it up directly once it is packaged or have it delivered to the customer at a minimal cost.
This application would be broken down into the following:

**Users Account:** This would provide a means for the user to create an account online. They would need to supply their firstname, lastname, current addresss, email address, and phone number. 
An username account would be created using and the customer can create their desired password. 
The email address would be linked so that the user can reset either their username or password by having a link sent to their email address.

**Administrator Account:** This would require a limited employee to create an admin account to manage the web application. 
Admins can do update inventory by  adding and deleting items off the inventory, update prices sort online orders. 
Admins can further prepare orders for pickup by informing the customer or have it set aside for delivery.

**Administrative:** The user would be able to sign in to browse through available products, save items in a list, add items to cart for checkout, and pay using either a credit card or a debit card. 
It should also have additional search feature to fast-track products for the user and provide weekly sales for users shopping online. 
Each order will generate an order number and confirmation number after the order is complete. 
The user should be able to see purchase history and view shopping list. 
Items/product would also be sorted by department and lastly, the sign in view page would have features like create an account, my purchases and my list.

**Customer service support:** This would provide the user with the means to seek support in the case they can’t access their account or other additional support not supported on the user’s interface. 
Example would be cancelling an order, requesting a refund or information on the delivery status if applicable. 
Contact information would be provided.

**Conclusion**
The overall logic is to create an opportunity for the user to shop online rather than heading out to the physical store on a busy day and avoid the long wait time checking out with the cashier.
